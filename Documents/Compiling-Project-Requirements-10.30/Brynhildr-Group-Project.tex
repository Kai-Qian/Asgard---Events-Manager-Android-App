\section{User Story}

\subsection{For Event Seekers}


Qin Shan is a Chinese student in Carnegie Mellon University and just moved to Pittsburgh. He is a graduate student with Information Networking Institute studying Master of Information Technology. He is an out-going person and loves to go to parties with friends. He also loves getting to know new people from different cultures and countries. However, a majority of his classmates are Chinese and he only knows people from his own country. It's Halloween tomorrow and he really wants to get to know more local people and participate in a Halloween party, which he has heard of in China but never had a chance to attend one. Course load of his program is very heavy and everybody almost has no leisure time. All his friends are too focused on studies and have no interest in going with him. But the more important problem is that he doesn't know where to go to attend such a party.

\vspace{1em}
Just at the right time, one of his friends recommends the app Event Manager to him, telling him that he can use it to browse events in the city, register himself if interested. He's very excited and downloads the app. First, he creates a user profile with his name, email, phone number and other necessary personal information. He uploads a very handsome picture as his profile picture. Then he logs in with his credentials and cannot wait to explore what information he can get from the app.

\vspace{1em}
He is presented with a list of event categories and is asked to select which ones interest him most and how far he is willing to go to attend events. He selects three categories: Festival Parties, Food Tasting, Wine Tasting and selects ``within 10 miles'' as the event venue range that he can accept. Upon clicking show events, he sees a calendar's weekly view of all event names listed for every single day. Two events catch his attention immediately: ``Qin Qian's House Halloween Party'' on Oct 31st, 8pm and ``Weikan Dan's Haunted House Party'' on Oct 30th, 9pm. He refers to his own schedule to see which time he's free. He found out that he is actually free for both dates and times. He's very happy and clicks the event 'Qin Qian's House Halloween Party', a drop down menu appears with 4 options: Register, Invite Friends, Contact Organizer and Waitlist Event. He clicks ``Register'' without hesitation. A window pops up and says: You information will be sent to the event organizer as a confirmation, would you like to proceed? He clicks yes and does exactly the same thing for ``Weikan Dan's Haunted House Party''. Although he sometimes gets scared easily, but he could not afford to miss this opportunity to experience a Haunted House Party in US. 

\vspace{1em}
Then he happily waits until the event date comes. But one day he gets a push notification from Event Manager app that ``Weikan Dan's Haunted House Party'' has been modified. He opens the app and sees that the venue of the event has been changed to a different address. He notes it down and realizes that he doesn't know whether he needs to dress up like what people do in Halloween parties. He clicks ``My Registered Events'' and then ``Contact Event Organizer'', asking what he should wear. He receives the feedback within 15min through the Message Center of the Event Manager app that he should be dressed up! Now he is really excited!
He goes to the party and really enjoys it! He comes to know a lot of other people from America, Germany, Singapore and so on. He has a great night, although really scared!

\subsection{For Event Organizers}
Weikan Dan is a American born Chinese who is a Pittsburgh citizen. For some reason his favorite festival is Halloween and organizes Halloween party or haunted house party every year, hoping to know more international people and also help international students in the local universities get in touch with local culture. In 2015, he starts to use Event Manager app, which is created by 3 CMU students and he really likes it after a while. Halloween is coming and this year he thinks of hosting a ``Haunted House Party'' for students.


After registering and logging into the app Event Manager, he clicks ``Launch Events'', and fills in all necessary information such as Event name, Venue, Date and time, Description, Dress code, Target audience. He also uploads a very well-designed poster in order to attract university students.


After about a week, he realizes that the venue he originally books is not available anymore, so he reopens the app after one week and goes to ``Manage Events'' => ``My launched events'' => ``Modify'', to modify the venue information. The app automatically broadcasts the change by sending push notifications to all registered participants. He also checks his Message Center. He answers all enquires and one of them is from Qin Shan, who is from the same town as his parents. He's excited to meet him.


He meets Qin Shan at the event and they have a wonderful time together! They discuss the app Event Manager and they both really love it! It's the best app ever!

\section{High Level Overview}
There are hundreds of events that are happening in a city everyday. Sometimes it can be really difficult for people to seek relative events they want to participate and for event organizers to promote their events to target audience. Our app Event Manager will bring event seekers and organizers to the same platform. Event seekers can view and select events to participate and organizers can post and broadcast their events. 

\subsection{Sub-problems for Two Types of User}
\subsubsection{Event Seekers: }
There are always times when people want to participate an event in order to achieve certain goals, be it to know more people, to pass time, to have fun or to learn something together. Especially when one is new to a city, this becomes extremely difficult without knowing anybody who can provide them with useful information. If this happens to you and when information can be limited and not always goes to the right target audience:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How would you know what are happening around you?
	\item How would you participate events that you are interested in?
	\item Even if you find a list of events to participate, how would you organize and manage them?
	\item What if you find something interesting but not sure whether you can attend it and want to save it for later?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Event Organizers: }
Now let's look at the same problem from the organizers' point of view. Imagine tomorrow is Halloween, you just moved to Pittsburgh and would like to organise a Halloween party at your place in order to know more people.

\begin{itemize}
	\item How would you inform the right people?
	\item How would you have enough people to participate so that everybody will have fun?
	\item How do you manage the list of participants?
	\item What if you want to change the event information, how would you inform all the confirmed participants?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Context Diagram}

Our app can help you solve all the problems, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ContextDiagram}, illustrating how event seekers and organizers can interact with the app to achieve their goals.

\subsection{Product Vision}
\subsubsection{For Event Seekers}
	An event seeker can easily search for any events he is interested in through this app. Moreover, he can easily register for the event with this app. A calendar view is also provided in our app so that one can easily view and organize his events. Another easy-using feature is also provided in this app that a waitlist which can hold the event which one has not decided to attend or not so that he can decide it later.
\subsubsection{For Event Organizers}
	For an event organizer, he definitely want the right people to attend his event. Our app can help so that he can broadcast his event. He can also decide how many people that can attend how how is the requirement of the attenders. Besides, our app also provides a functionality that the organizer can push the notifications to all participants.
